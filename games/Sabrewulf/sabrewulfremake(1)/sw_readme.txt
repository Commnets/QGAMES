The Overly Cryptic Ultimate Plot
================================

              THE HAPPENING
Down and down I plunged, through Rocky Glades, Steep Ravines and
Shady Hollows ... No grip, no footholds, slipping, tumbling,
spinning, darker and darker, deeper and deeper.

Glinting eyes, clutching hands, clasping claws, clawing my all,
as I swiftly twist and tumble onwards.

Darker and darker, deeper and deeper. It is the end that I fear,
of this untroden voyage ... to where I do not know ... AARRRGGGG
... THUDDD ...

Fall and end meet on soft mossy soil ... with weapons drawn and
senses full I move quickly and quietly around the mounded clearing
... All safe except a message ... An ancient warning etched deep
into the lifeless stone.

              THE WARNING

THY PATH IS LONG SO TREAD WITH CARE
BEWARE THE WULF AND PASS HIS LAIR
DANGER THREATENS ALL AROUND
SO TAKE YE FROM THIS HIDDEN MOUND
TO FREE THEE FROM THIS SUNKEN GATE
BY WAY OF CAVE OR MEET THY FATE
AN AMULET TO SEEK THY WILL
'TWAS SPLIT BY QUAD AND HIDDEN STILL
PASS THE KEEPER WROUGHT WITH HATE
TO GAIN AN ENTRANCE TO THE GATE
THE PIECES LOST MUST THEE AMAS
FOR IF NO CHARM THEN NON SHALL PASS

              THE EXPLORATION

I edge through the shady mounded clearing and on through the
dense thickets of hot house rain forest undergrowth, of sorts I
cannot tell, and wait...and listen...Distant rumblings of heavy
feet crashing, large animals leap from the damp green stubble,
to  fight and kill.

I stay hidden ... The rumblings grow louder and louder, as a huge
Goliath animal crashes past, horns swiping and tail lashing,
still I hide as its thunderous noise dies away.

All was clear as I leapt over the clumps and onto the well
trodden pathway, its deep ruts and prints reveal the multitude
of life forms inhabiting this hollow.  Danger threatens so I
should move quickly ... But Where???

              THE EXPEDITION

Wide eyed, I stare, as the dense surroundings reveal their hidden
secrets ... Strange food orchids suddenly bloom, their staining
toxins, strong on the air, then, in an instant, are gone.
Hunters, killers, vampire bats and huge beasts spring forth from
the very ground, swimming, slithering, diving and crawling ... I
must hide ... Stay safe ... With weapon strong and cunning nature,
I will survive ...
