                                4. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I never did believe in Ghosts or Monsters... Not until now, not until the Main
doors of the Castle closed and locked themselves behind me... There's no key
here!!! I'm trapped!!! HELP!!!... HEELLLPPPP!!!!... No-one can hear me... I'm
alone... Why do the doors open and slam shut??!!... Is anybody there??...
HHEELLLLPPPP!!!!... I can see strange shapes materialising on the other side
of the room... Evil eyes glaring at me... Footsteps... Somethings coming down
the corridor... Something large... Something cold... I must run quickly...
QUICKLY... HHEELLLLPPPP!!!!... I must escape before it's too late!!!!!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  5. THE GAME
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have been trapped in the evil haunted Castle, your object is to
find the hidden Golden Key of A.C.G. and escape via your only exit, the Main
Doors.

The Castle consists of 5 floors, including the 'Atic' and the caverns, which
contain countless rooms. Within the many rooms you may find furniture, food,
drink, objects, Ghosts, Ghouls and Monsters. Eat and drink sparingly so that
you do not deplete your food supply. Collect and utilise any objects you find
to your best advantage, be wary of slamming doors and working trapdoors which
will try to trap you and avoid contact with all the Ghouls and Monsters, as
each of these will use their best endeavours to hamper your search.

Each of the characters, Knight, Surf and Wizard, are armed with their own
specific weapons, individual movement type and use of one set of secret
passages, unbeknown to the others.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 6. CONTROLS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The game can be played with keyboard or joystick. The keyboard controls can be
redefine from the main menu. They default to the following:

Cursor keys - Move up, down, left & right
Spacebar - Fire
Z - Pickup/drop
Esc - Pause/Options

Your joystick will be automatically detected and does not need configuring. It
will work alongside the keyboard controls.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have difficulty running Atic Atac then please feel free to contact me
with as much information about the problem as possible. Also include details on
your system. My contact details can be found below.

I am more than happy to help, however emails along the lines of "Atic Atac
doesn't work, what's wrong?" will be ignored. If you can't be bothered to fully
explain the problem then I won't bother replying to you.

I'm doing this in my own free time, a little courtesy costs nothing.
